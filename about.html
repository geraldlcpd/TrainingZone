  <p><img class="img-display" src="images/329649_9775.jpg">Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they  can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it:</p>

<article>
<ul>
  <li>Realize that it's up to you. You are responsible for  making it work. </li>
  <li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other  (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). </li>
  <li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell  you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. </li>
	<li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with  that decision are:</li>
  
  
     <ul>
     <li>If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. </li>
    <li>Which one are you most on top of? </li>
	<li>Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? </li>
	   </ul>

	 
  
  <li>Don't ask your lecturer - &quot;did I miss anything in  the lecture?&quot; If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to  lectures.</li>
